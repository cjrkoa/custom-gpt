It helps to enhance the performance, reliability, and availability of applications by efficiently managing the incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate server based on various factors like server load, geographical location, or server health. Load balancers are commonly used in web applications, cloud computing, and networking to optimize resource utilization and ensure high availability of services."}
